# Aloha Project
Programs and tools used:
    Visual Studio Code
    Google Chrome
    Dev tools

Personal Learnings:
    The more I explore and experiment, the more I start to understand how each property reacts and relates to each other. Still trying to completely understand how to effectively use Position: (eg. form button)

    Used comments to effectively split into sections for easier viewing.
    Included specs in stylesheet for easy reference while working on the project.
