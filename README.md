# _2017 ARCHIVED_

# Aloha part 1 (RED Project 1)

## Programs and tools used:
* Visual Studio Code

## Personal Learnings:
The more I explore and experiment, the more I start to understand how each property reacts and relates to each other. Still trying to completely understand how to effectively use Position: (eg. form button). Used comments to effectively split into sections for easier viewing. Included specs in stylesheet for easy reference while working on the project
